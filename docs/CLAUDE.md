2. **reference_2.jpg**: Clean service presentation with 3-card layout - Ideal for card-3 implementation
3. **reference_3.jpg**: Editorial minimal design with image+text split - Perfect for image-text-horizontal
4. **reference_4.webp**: Professional portfolio dark theme - Excellent title-slide with black theme example
5. **reference_5.webp**: Editorial story layout with dramatic typography - Perfect for text-center with black theme

**Added Analysis**:

- Layout relevance mapping to project layouts
- Design principle analysis (typography, color, spacing)
- Implementation guidelines based on references

### Technical Insights Discovered

#### Animation and Transition Specifications
- **Parallax Effects**: Background moves faster than foreground during transitions
- **Fade Timing**: 0.3-0.5 seconds for smooth web-standard timing
- **Sequential Animations**: Logical order with timing gaps for multiple elements
- **Hardware Acceleration**: CSS transforms and opacity for smooth performance

#### Responsive Design Requirements
- **Target**: Landscape screens only (no mobile support needed)
- **Content Fitting**: All content must fit without scrolling (except timeline)
- **Font Scaling**: Typography should scale appropriately for different screen sizes
- **Aspect Ratio**: Flexible design accommodating various landscape ratios

#### File Structure and Build Process
- **Input**: YAML files in `content/` directory
- **Output**: Self-contained HTML presentations in `presentations/` directory
- **Assets**: Images copied to individual `assets/` folders per presentation
- **Build Script**: `build.js` orchestrates the entire conversion process

### User Interaction Patterns

#### Communication Style Preferences
- **User Language**: Japanese with occasional English technical terms
- **Response Preference**: User appreciated concise, direct responses
- **Documentation Needs**: User wanted comprehensive, self-contained documentation
- **Visual Elements**: User specifically requested checkbox functionality for task tracking

#### User Priorities
1. **Comprehensive Documentation**: User wanted everything documented for future reference
2. **Task Management**: Strong emphasis on trackable progress with visual indicators
3. **Design Fidelity**: Important to capture exact visual specifications from references
4. **Bilingual Support**: Both English and Japanese versions needed

### Implementation Considerations

#### Development Approach
- **Philosophy**: "Simple is the Best" - focus only on specified functionality
- **Technology Stack**: npm, modern CSS animations, ES6+ JavaScript
- **Browser Support**: Modern browsers only (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Performance**: Hardware acceleration and smooth animations prioritized

#### Potential Challenges Identified
1. **Timeline Layout Complexity**: Horizontal scrolling with smooth interactions will be most complex
2. **Animation Sequencing**: Coordinating multiple elements with proper timing
3. **Responsive Scaling**: Ensuring content fits without scrolling across screen sizes
4. **Asset Management**: Proper relative paths and optimization pipeline

#### Success Factors
1. **Detailed Specifications**: Every layout has precise margin and behavior specifications
